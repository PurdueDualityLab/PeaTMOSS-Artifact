## About

This directory contains utility functions and classes that the *PTMTorrent*
dataset code base utilizes to accomplish download repositories and parse
metadata from model hubs.

These functions and classes are unique to this particular codebase and are not
recommended to be reused as dependencies outside of this project.

The [`schemas/`](schemas/) directory contains the JSON Schemas that were used to
understand and parse the data.
